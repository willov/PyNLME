### Migration Guide

For users coming from MATLAB:

```matlab
% MATLAB
[beta, psi, stats, b] = nlmefit(X, y, group, [], @model, beta0, 'Options', opts);
```

```python
# PyNLME (Python) - MATLAB-style interface
beta, psi, stats, b = nlmefit(X, y, group, None, model, beta0, **opts)

# PyNLME (Python) - Python-style unified interface
beta, psi, stats, b = fit_nlme(X, y, group, None, model, beta0, method="ML", **opts)
```

The function signatures are nearly identical, with the main differences being:
- Empty matrices `[]` in MATLAB become `None` in Python
- Function handles `@model` become function references `model`
- Options structs become keyword arguments
- New unified `fit_nlme()` function provides method parameter for algorithm selection

### Changed
- **Simplified Function Interface**: Reduced from 7+ function aliases to just 3 essential functions
  - `nlmefit()` - MATLAB-compatible Maximum Likelihood Estimation
  - `nlmefitsa()` - MATLAB-compatible Stochastic Approximation EM

  - Removed excessive aliases: `fit_mixed_effects()`, `fit_nlmm()`, `nlme()`, `nlmm()`
- **Dynamic Version Management**: Version now extracted from `pyproject.toml` using `importlib.metadata`
  - Replaced hardcoded `__version__ = "0.1.0"` with dynamic extraction
  - Single source of truth for versioning
- **Updated Documentation**: All docs now reflect simplified interface
  - Updated tutorial to show both MATLAB and Python-style usage
  - Simplified API reference and examples
  - Cleaner, more maintainable interface

### Fixed
